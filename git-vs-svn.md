## Git

- DVCS: entire codebase on every developer's machine.
- Almost all functions are done locally/offline.
- Easy CLI and GUI clients(Gitbash, SourceTree, Tower, etc.) to start with.
- Latest and most popular tool for SCM.

## Git branching is better than SVN

- Easy to create, switch, share, collaborate, sync and merge.
- Can be done frequently.
- Local and remote branches.
- Boosts experimental branches with confidence of not breaking anything.
- Submit pull requests for peer review before code gets merged.

## Gitflow workflow is ideal

- Multiple vendors.
- Multiple teams.
- Multiple projects.
- Effective version control across these projects.
- Best for CICD.

## Gitlab community edition

- Free
- Within premises
- Web hooks to achieve CICD


## Disadvantages:

- Learning curve involved.
- Can be difficult without guidance.
- No global version number.
